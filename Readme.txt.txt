This piece of software contains two programs.

Upon start you will notice a menu asking to either select: 0 or 1. This will trigger either the sorting program or the linked-list program.

The first program is designed to sort an array of numbers based on the configuration outlaid in the input file named: "input-a1q1.txt".

The first value in the input file refers to ascending or descending sorting results.
The second value refers to complexity (worst case scenario). => quicksort for worst-case (n^2) and mergesort (Ologn) for bestcase.
The third value refers to the number of elements in the proceeding line.
The fourth line is the data to be sorted.

Please be mindful of inserting the correct data, although this program has exceptional error handling.
It does not have any tests to prove it.

The program should output a file "output-a1q1.txt" containing the sorted data on the first line, with a timestamp on the second line.

The second program is designed to take an input from the file named: "input-a1q2.txt", this is a number.
The number is used a limit on the loop. The program generates 'n' random numbers equal to the value in the input file.

insertAtStart
insertAtEnd
deleteFromStart
deleteFromEnd

are methods used to insert/delete the randomly generated numbers. Each method is timed with insertAtEnd and deleteFromEnd appearing to have 
On^2 time complexity and insertAtStart/deleteFromStart appear to have O(nlogn) time complexity.

Please enjoy!
